- [] Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

I love productivity and for my capstone project I built a "Productivity System" it features a calendar, to do list, a pomodoro timer and a user log in screen. I'd love to build this site into an app. If I'm mainly thinking of a smaller idea, building a pomodoro timer would be really cool as well. Pomodoro is an effective study technique where you work in a minimum of 25 minute intervals and rest for 5 minutes. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

In the beginning building the app was smooth. It was a differentfrom wjhat I was used to but the real challeng came when I had to link my button.This took me the most amount of time because I struggled and was stuckfor a long time but after taking things very slow and doing some plug and play, things started to fall into place. Figuring out my problem and seeing my button work was the best feeling.
